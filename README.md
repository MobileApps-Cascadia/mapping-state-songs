# PROJECT SCOPE

Mission
----------
# Objectives (what we want the project to accomplish, not just the app functionality)

1. To build a platform that can represent the state songs project created by the integrated learning
   class and make it available to the users.
   a.  Ability to read and utilize information from a QR code.
   b.  Ability to play a song (state) obtained from QR code on a mobile device.
   c.  Ability to display text information obtained from QR code on a mobile device.

//comment: I like the idea of building this app. I think there are very few people that know or heard their state song, and
I think that people will be interested in an app that plays their state song. However i do think that in addition to that
our app should tell the users about places of interests in that particular state.

Users Description
Our main user audience will be students from Cascadia & UW Bothell. 
The school faculty, teachers, & alumni. Our secondary user audience are people from all walks of life. 
Since this is an integrated app that will be designed by students from different majors,the app will attract 
friends & family members from those students, which will also be our user audience.
